# MUO Agent Handoff — Full Context Restore

**Date:** 2026-11-12  
**Branch:** `maclark/check-pattern-refactor`  
**Remote agent fork:** `rosa-agent/managed-upgrade-operator`  
**Local agent fork:** `nephomaniac/managed-upgrade-operator`  
**Upstream (read-only reference):** `openshift/managed-upgrade-operator`

---

## Two-Agent Collaboration Model

| Agent | Where | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Remote agent** (this sandbox) | `/sandbox/muo-workspace/` | Writes Go/TS code, commits, pushes to `rosa-agent` fork |
| **Local agent** (maclark's machine) | Clone of `nephomaniac` fork | Pulls from `rosa-agent`, builds images, deploys to cluster, tests, writes results to `/sandbox/ai-status/` |

**Communication:** Local agent drops status files in `/sandbox/ai-status/`. Remote agent reads them between coding sessions.

---

## Cluster & Registry

| Resource | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cluster console | `console-openshift-console.apps.maclarkstg1102.3e6y.s1.devshift.org` |
| MUO operator namespace | `openshift-managed-upgrade-operator` |
| Operator image registry | `quay.io/maclark/managed-upgrade-operator:<TAG>` |
| Plugin image registry | `quay.io/maclark/muo-pko:<TAG>` (the PKO bundle image) |
| PKO resource | `ClusterPackage/managed-upgrade-operator` |

---

## Repository Setup (remote agent)

```bash
git clone "https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/rosa-agent/managed-upgrade-operator.git" muo-workspace
cd muo-workspace
git checkout maclark/check-pattern-refactor
git config user.email "rosa-agent@redhat.com"
git config user.name "rosa-agent"
```

Push after changes:
```bash
git remote set-url origin "https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/rosa-agent/managed-upgrade-operator.git"
git push origin maclark/check-pattern-refactor
```

## What This Branch Adds (vs upstream master)

### Feature: UpgradeDiagsCheck CRD + Controller

A new subsystem (`upgradediags`) sits alongside the main MUO operator as a **separate container** (`args: [upgradediags]`). It:

1. Accepts `POST /api/v1/upgrade-diags` from the console plugin (via OpenShift console proxy `muo-api`)
2. Creates an internal `UpgradeDiagsCheck` CR in `openshift-managed-upgrade-operator`
3. Controller reconciles the CR, runs registered checks, writes results back to CR status
4. `GET /api/v1/upgrade-diags/{id}` polls for results
5. `GET /api/v1/upgrade-status` returns a live upgrade-state snapshot (no CR)
6. `GET /api/v1/upgrade-status/history` returns CVO upgrade history (no CR)

### Feature: OpenShift Dynamic Console Plugin

A webpack/Module Federation console plugin shows in the OpenShift Console under **Administration → Upgrade Diagnostics**. It lets users:
- View all `UpgradeDiagsCheck` CRs in a live-updating table
- Create new checks via a form (version/channel dropdowns from ClusterVersion)
- Expand rows to see per-check results

---

## Key Files Changed vs Upstream

### Go — API types

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `api/v1alpha1/upgradediagscheck_types.go` | CRD types: `UpgradeDiagsCheck`, `UpgradeDiagsCheckSpec/Status`, `DiagsCheckResult` |
| `api/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go` | Auto-generated deep-copy (updated for new types) |

### Go — Controller

| File | Description |

podman push quay.io/maclark/muo-pko:$TAG

echo "Built TAG=$TAG — use this in deploy step"
```

---

## Deploy Instructions (local agent)

```bash
TAG="<tag from build step>"
NS="openshift-managed-upgrade-operator"

# 5. Remove old CRD if it still has the old name (upgradereadinesschecks)
oc get crd upgradereadinesschecks.upgrade.managed.openshift.io 2>/dev/null && \
  oc delete crd upgradereadinesschecks.upgrade.managed.openshift.io

# 6. Delete and recreate ClusterPackage to pick up new images
oc delete clusterpackage managed-upgrade-operator --ignore-not-found
sleep 5

oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: package-operator.run/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterPackage
metadata:

EOF

# 7. Watch rollout (should reach Available=True in ~3 minutes)
watch oc get clusterpackage managed-upgrade-operator

# 8. Verify pods
oc get pods -n $NS
# Expected: managed-upgrade-operator-* Running, upgradediags-* Running

# 9. Enable console plugin (one-time if not already done)
oc patch console.operator cluster \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"plugins":["managed-upgrade-operator"]}}'
```

---

## Test Instructions (local agent)

### Test A: HTTP API — upgrade-diags

```bash
NS="openshift-managed-upgrade-operator"
SVC="managed-upgrade-operator-upgradediags"
TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)

# Port-forward (or use Route if present)
oc port-forward -n $NS svc/$SVC 8443:8443 &
PF_PID=$!
sleep 2

# Check catalog (no auth needed)
curl -sk https://localhost:8443/api/v1/upgrade-diags/checks | jq '.total'
# Expected: 12 (or however many registered checks)

# Create a diagnostics run
curl -sk -X POST https://localhost:8443/api/v1/upgrade-diags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"targetVersion":"4.22.22","targetChannel":"fast-4.22","platform":"OSD"}' | jq .
# Expected: {"requestId":"...","status":"accepted","statusUrl":"/api/v1/upgrade-diags/..."}

# Poll for results (wait ~30-60s)
REQUEST_ID="<id from above>"
curl -sk https://localhost:8443/api/v1/upgrade-diags/$REQUEST_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '{status, overallStatus, checksTotal, checksPassed, checksFailed}'

kill $PF_PID
```

### Test B: HTTP API — upgrade-status (NEW)

```bash
TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)
oc port-forward -n $NS svc/$SVC 8443:8443 &
PF_PID=$!; sleep 2

# Live upgrade status snapshot
curl -sk https://localhost:8443/api/v1/upgrade-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '{phase, targetVersion, currentVersion, elapsedSeconds, blockers}'

# Upgrade history
curl -sk https://localhost:8443/api/v1/upgrade-status/history \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.history[0:3]'

kill $PF_PID
```

**Expected upgrade-status results:**
- `phase`: likely `not-started` if no upgrade is in progress
- `targetVersion`: empty if no `DesiredUpdate` is set on ClusterVersion
- `currentVersion`: should match `oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.status.desired.version}'`
- `blockers`: empty array if cluster is healthy
- History: list of past upgrades with start/completion times

### Test C: Console Plugin — Upgrade Diagnostics page

1. Open `console-openshift-console.apps.maclarkstg1102.3e6y.s1.devshift.org`
2. Navigate to **Administration → Upgrade Diagnostics**
3. Verify table loads (may be empty if no checks run yet)
4. Click **Run New Diagnostics**
5. Select version and channel (dropdowns should auto-populate from ClusterVersion)
6. Click **Run** — form should close, row should appear in table
7. Wait 30s, row status should update to Completed/Passed/Failed

### Test D: Check CRs from CLI

```bash
oc get upgradediagschecks -n openshift-managed-upgrade-operator
# or short name:
oc get udc -n openshift-managed-upgrade-operator
# Should show CR with name like udc-4-22-22-osd-XXXXX
```

---

## Reporting Results (local agent)

Write results to `/sandbox/ai-status/` with descriptive names:

```bash
# Success
echo "PASS" > /sandbox/ai-status/RESULT_UPGRADE_STATUS_API
echo "Phase B ready for implementation" > /sandbox/ai-status/TRIGGER_PHASE_B

# Failure — include enough detail to diagnose
cat > /sandbox/ai-status/RESULT_UPGRADE_STATUS_FAIL <<EOF
Test B failed: upgrade-status returns 500
Error: reading ClusterVersion: <error message>
Pod logs:
$(oc logs -n openshift-managed-upgrade-operator deploy/managed-upgrade-operator -c upgradediags --tail=30)
EOF
```

---

## Known Issues / Watch-Outs

1. **Old CRD conflict:** If `upgradereadinesschecks.upgrade.managed.openshift.io` CRD still exists from a prior deploy, delete it before applying the new `upgradediagschecks` CRD. PKO's collision-protection won't remove the old one automatically.

2. **Image visibility:** PKO bundle image (`muo-pko`) must be publicly readable on Quay.io or PKO will get `UNAUTHORIZED`. Check Quay.io repo visibility settings.

3. **Console plugin cache:** After deploying, the console may serve stale plugin assets for 1-2 minutes. Hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) or wait.

4. **consoleFetch is GET-only:** The console proxy (`muo-api`) only supports GET. The plugin uses `consoleFetch` for GET requests and the console proxy routes them to port 8443. POST to create checks goes directly to K8s API via `k8sCreate` — this is intentional, not a bug.

5. **TLS cert timing:** The `muo-upgradediags-tls` secret is created by the OpenShift serving-cert controller after the Service exists. PKO phase ordering (`certs` before `deploy`) handles this, but if the secret is missing, the upgradediags container will log a warning and the HTTP service will be disabled.

## Context Restore from Backup

If `/sandbox/backups/` has a `*.tar.gz`:

```bash
ls /sandbox/backups/
tar xzf /sandbox/backups/<latest>.tar.gz -C /tmp/restore/
cat /tmp/restore/AGENT_HANDOFF.md   # this file
```
